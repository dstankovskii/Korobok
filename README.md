# KorobOK - Algorithmic Game for Kids

KorobOK is an educational game designed for children aged 6-10, preparing them for the basics of programming. Developed in Unity using C#, this 2D isometric game features 12 levels, with a storyline where players guide a robot through various tasks. The game teaches fundamental algorithmic concepts such as linear sequences, branching, and loops through a series of engaging levels.

## Features
- **Educational Gameplay**: Children learn algorithmic structures such as linear sequences, branching, and loops.
- **12 Levels**: Each level introduces new challenges and programming concepts.
- **Engaging Storyline**: Help the robot "KorobOK" restore the ecology of the planet by delivering plant crates to fertile soil.
- **Custom Graphics**: All game models and objects are custom-designed.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Bright and attractive UI, designed for children.
- **Real-time Evaluation**: The game evaluates the efficiency of the algorithm with a star system based on the number of commands and usage of algorithmic structures.
- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Runs on Android (versions 4.2 to 6.0).

## Controls and Gameplay
Players will need to:
- Move the robot using simple commands like "move forward", "turn left", and "turn right".
- Avoid obstacles like radiation by using algorithmic branching.
- Complete tasks with fewer commands by using loops.

## How to Play
1. Select a level from the menu.
2. Program the robot's actions using the command panel.
3. Run the program and see if the robot completes the task successfully.
4. Review your program and improve it to score higher.

## Educational Purpose
KorobOK is an excellent tool to introduce children to programming. It can be used in computer science classes, robotics lessons, or simply for fun educational activities at home. The game is divided into three stages:
- **Stage 1 (Levels 1-4)**: Linear sequences.
- **Stage 2 (Levels 5-8)**: Branching logic.
- **Stage 3 (Levels 9-12)**: Loops and repetitive actions.
